# Honor Code
In this assignment, we are going to establish a honor code. It means I am going to trust on your abilities, I will trust that you and you alone worked on your submission, and it will reflect your efforts. In case you take help from a friend, or a classmate, or a website, or from any other source - you will have to provide the details about how you received the help and to what extent. Please include details of how you received help in the [Contributions.md](Contributions.md) file in case you take help. Your code will be checked for plagiarism, and if your code fails to follow the honor code, your marks and grade will be severely affected.
